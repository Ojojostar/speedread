Hello this is a speed reading app i am currently working on to get dev skills good.  
currently pretty barebones design while i get things working relatively smoothly.  
created because my philo class requires me to do too much reading but then I realized that speed reading killed comprehension too much plus the PDFs were scanned pretty poorly so getting things to work well was not particulary viable so progress shall be relatively slow.
