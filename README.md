Hello this is a speed reading app i am currently working on to get dev skills good.  
currently pretty barebones design while i get things working relatively smoothly.  

created because my philo class requires me to do too much reading but then I realized that speed reading killed comprehension too much plus the given PDFs were scanned pretty poorly so shall be working on getting ocr to work better in the meantime.
