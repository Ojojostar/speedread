  
Death 
If death is the unequivocal and permanent end of our existence, 
the question arises whether it is a bad thing to die. 
There is conspicuous disagreement about the matter: some 
people think death is dreadful; others have no objection to‘death 
per se, though they hope their own will be neither premature nor painful. Those in the former category tend to think those in the 
latter are blind to the obvious, while the latter suppose the 
former to be prey to some sort of confusion. On the one hand it 
can be said that life is all we have and the loss of it is the greatest 
loss we can sustain. On the other hand it may be objected that 
death deprives this supposed loss of its subject, and that if we 
realize that death is not an unimaginable condition of the 
persisting person, but a mere blank, we will see that it can have 
no value whatever, positive or negative. 
Since I want to leave aside the question whether we are, or 
might be, immortal in some form, I shall simply use the word 
‘death’ and its cognates in this discussion to mean permanent 
death, unsupplemented by any form of conscious survival. | 
want to ask whether death is in itself an evil; and how great an 
evil, and of what kind, it might be. The question should be of 
interest even to those who believe in some form of immortality, 
for one’s attitude toward immortality must depend in part on 
one’s attitude toward death. 
If death is an evil at all, it cannot be because of its positive 
features, but only because of what it deprives us of. I shall try to deal with the difficulties surrounding the natural view that death 
is an evil because it brings to an end all the goods that life
